ldesc: "With the win-ssh-agent, we can use the ssh-agent (available in
the cygwin openssh) in the more smart way.

Normally, we need to start all relevant programs, which might
need to use the ssh, as child processes of the shell
(e.g. bash) in which you eval'ed the ssh-agent.  Because, the
programs must be able to refer to environment variables that
set by the ssh-agent.

The win-ssh-agent enables all programs to refer to the
environment variables of the ssh-agent, i.e. the
SSH_AUTH_SOCK.  Now, we no longer need to start programs as
child processes of the shell."
